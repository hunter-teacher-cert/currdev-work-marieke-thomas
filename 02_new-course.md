# New Course Idea: Web Design

## General Description
This is an introductory web design course using HTML/CSS/JS. Students would first learn how to program static web pages using HTML/CSS, and later learn how to make their sites interactive using JavaScript. Students would learn how to link their site to a database using Firebase in order to create persistent changes. Projects would include an "About Me" static page, a quiz site using JavaScript, a message board using databases, and a final group project.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this course is juniors and seniors at my school. This course could appeal to artistically-inclined students who are interested in graphic design, as well as students who are primarily interested in programming in general.

## Where it Fits
This course would occur after students have taken the required 1-semester sophomore Coding for All course, which is based in Python. While the school offers a wide array of programming electives, none of them focus on web design or teach HTML/CSS/JS, so I believe that this course would be a valuable addition to the options available. Many students who enjoy Coding for All take APCSA as juniors, so this course would be a potential senior elective that would allow those students to expand their programming repertoire, learning a new language and a useful skillset. On the other hand, I also think this course would be a cood option for juniors who are not interested in APCSA, either because they don't want the time commitment of an AP course, don't meet the grade cutoff, or because they want a course that is less prescriptive and more creative. Most of the school's other CS electives require APCSA as a prerequisite, so I believe that this course would fill a niche for students who are interested in programming but don't want to take APCSA.

## Course Prerequisites
Students must have taken and passed Coding for All. Students who scored below an 85 in Coding for All may require extra time on the course assignments, bue I believe the material is accessible and don't want to exclude students who could be successful in the course, so I would not impose a grade cutoff.
