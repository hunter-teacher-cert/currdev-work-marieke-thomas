# Technical Tools in the Classroom
## Tool 1: TinkerCad
### General Purpose:
Allows students to prototype designs (including circuits, 3D printing designs, and more)

### Class Used:
Electrical Engineering

### How I Use It:
I use TinkerCad in order for my students to be able to simulate their circuit designs, particularly with Arduinos. Using TinkerCad helps students troubleshoot issues and isolate software vs hardware problems-- if the design works perfectly in TinkerCad but not in real life, that means there's likely a hardware issue rather than a bug in their code. However, if the program doesn't run correctly on TinkerCad, there is likely to be a code error that students need to debug. For longer projects, I make my students prototype the project in TinkerCad before building it for real. I also use TinkerCad when teaching students aobut LCDs, because the LCDs have a very complicated set-up with many wires. TinkerCad has a built-in LCD starter which has the components correctly wired so that students can dive right into coding cool messages.

### Why This Tool
As far as I know, TinkerCad is the only tool available to simulate Arduino-based circuits. It has a great IDE that allows for block-based and text-based coding and is extremely user-friendly.


## Tool 2: Google Classroom
### General Purpose:
Allows teachers to post assignments, supplemental materials, and messages for a class of students.

### Class Used:
Electrical Engineering, AP Chemistry

### How I Use It:
I use Google Classroom to post assignments for my students and send messages to them. I don't use it for daily assignments for AP Chem, but I do use it to post digital materials like test review sheets. In Electrical Engineering, I do use Google Classroom to post and collect daily assignments because many of these assignments are online and the class happens in a computer lab, making it easy for students to come in each day, check the assignment on GC, do the assignment, and then submit it to me.

### Why This Tool
It is free, ubiquitous, and required by the school. I don't actually think it's super user-friendly (at least not compared to Google's other products) but I do like how easy it is to post and collect assignments. It also syncs easily to Google Drive, and you can recycle posts from previous years which is a time-saver.
