# Technical Tools in the Classroom
## Tool 1: TinkerCad
### General Purpose:
Allows students to prototype designs (including circuits, 3D printing designs, and more)

### Class Used:
Electrical Engineering

### How I Use It:
I use TinkerCad in order for my students to be able to simulate their circuit designs, particularly with Arduinos. Using TinkerCad helps students troubleshoot issues and isolate software vs hardware problems-- if the design works perfectly in TinkerCad but not in real life, that means there's likely a hardware issue rather than a bug in their code. However, if the program doesn't run correctly on TinkerCad, there is likely to be a code error that students need to debug. For longer projects, I make my students prototype the project in TinkerCad before building it for real. I also use TinkerCad when teaching students aobut LCDs, because the LCDs have a very complicated set-up with many wires. TinkerCad has a built-in LCD starter which has the components correctly wired so that students can dive right into coding cool messages.
