# Language Analysis

## What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
Intro to Web Design-- this is not a course I currently teach but one which I think should be offered at our school as we don't currently have any web design courses.

This would be an elective course for upperclassmen (juniors and seniors) who have taken the 1-semester required Coding for All (python-based intro CS) class at the school. 

## What is the language?

JavaScript

## How does one write & run code in this language?

Can be run in many systems such as replit, glitch, or even directly on github.

## Rate the complexity of the syntax?

3/10 It is more complicated than python (which is probably the simplest text-based language) but simpler than Java and most other text-based languages.

## Strengths

The biggest strength is the versatility. This is a language that is used everywhere and has huge applications for industry and jobs. It is also possible to build all sorts of really different projects using the language.

## How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

I would utilize the strengths by giving students really open-ended projects that they could tailor to their own interests.

## Weaknesses

The main weakness to me is that the syntax is more complicated than python, which would be the text-based language that my students would be familiar with. It is not whitespace-sensitive so itstead it uses a lot more punctuation marks in ways that might be confusing to students.

## How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

I would make sure to review the syntax very carefully and offer lots of example debugging exercises to help students recognize and get comfortable with debugging basic syntax errors.

## Why did you select this language for this class?

JavaScript is the basic language of web development so it makes sense to use this language for a web development class! It is automatically integrated with HTML/CSS unlike python where you would need a program such as Flask to link the two.
