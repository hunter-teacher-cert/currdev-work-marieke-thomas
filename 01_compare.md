# Curriculum Comparison
I will be comparing the curriculum that I use for my Arduino-based Electrical Engineering class with the "Electrical Foundations with Arduino" curriculum from CS-STEM Network, which is by Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy.

## Major Similarities
* Both curricula start the year with a unit on basic circuits (in the CS-STEM version it is called "Wiring and Circuits"). In both cases, the first lesson is on the simplest possible circuit. In this unit, both curricula discuss short circuits and switches. Both had a mini-project using electical tape.
* The second unit is also very similar for both curricula. In both cases, the second unit is on Series and Parallel circuits.
* Both curricula have a unit discussing motors.
* Both curricula discuss signals and relays.
* Both curricula discuss sensors, including distance sensors.

## Major Differences
* The CS-STEM curriculum is geared towards students who don't necessarily have any knowledge of physics, whereas my curriculum is targeted towards students who have taken or are taking Regents Physics (or a higher-level physics course). My curriculum requires more math skills and problem-solving than the CS-STEM curriculum.
* The major differences start to appear after the second unit. My curriculum focuses on Electrical Power, including basic power calculations, power comparisons for different types of lightbulbs, AC vs DC, and the US electrical grid. None of this is emphasized in the CS-STEM curriculum.
* Both curricula discuss motors, but the CS-STEM unit for motors focuses on the relationship between voltage and current with a motor as an example. In contrast, my curriculum discusses motors as part of a unit on electromagnets, so the emphasis is on magnetic fields and applying the hand rules for magnetism.
* Although both curricula discuss signals and relays, the CS-STEM version does this explicitly in the context of Arduinos, whereas I do this before introducing Arduinos to the class. I instead incorporate a discussion of transistors and logic gates, which is not part of the CS-STEM version.
* The CS-STEM Sensors unit focuses on distance sensors, whereas my discussion of sensors focuses more on light and temperature sensors, with a smaller amount of time spent using distance sensors.
* The CS-STEM curriculum includes an E-Panel unit to create wiring harnesses, which is not at all something that I discuss in my class.

## Comparative Strengths and Weaknesses
* My curriculum involves some more artistic projects and has more of a STEAM emphasis.
* The CS-STEM curriculum emphasizes the basics in a very clear way and spends more time on them. I think this can be both a strength and a weakness depending on the student population. I believe that the CS-STEM curriculum is intended for students with less background in physics than my course, so this emphasis on the basics is really helpful. On the other hand, at my school students are required to take Regents Physics (or AP) and so this section of the course might seem tedious and uninteresting. Thus I have tried to emphasize more complex systems and challenges in my curriculum. I believe this would be a weakness if my curriculum were used in a different school, as students would be missing the opportunity to really develop a strong understanding of several key ideas when it comes to circuits.




Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.
Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
