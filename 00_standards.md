## Lesson Description

### Lesson Topic: Bias in Facial Recognition

1. Using Google's Teachable Machine, train the computer to recognize "rock", "paper", and "scissors" hand gestures

2. Students trade computers. They try to get the algorithm to idenitfy their hand gestures.

3. Class discussion: Did it work? Why/why not? What did you notice? Why do you think it did this?
Possible responses:
* It worked some of the time.
* It depended more on the distance to the computer instead of the shape of the hand
* It changed based on how I held my hand
* It changed based on the angle of my arm
* etc.

4. Continue class discussion: How does machine learning work?
* The computer is comparing the current picture with the training pictures. If in the training pictures, you happened to hold your hand closer for "rock" than for "scissors", then when someone else tries to do "scissors" but holds their hand too close, the computer may mischaracterize it as "rock" instead.
* Garbage in, garbage out: If the data a machine learns from is flawed, the artificial intelligence will be flawed.

5. Video: AI, Ain't I A Woman? - Joy Buolamwini

AI frequently misgenders black women specifically. This is partially because of a lack of black women represented in the training data used to create the AI.

6. Pair share: What is your reaction to the video?

8. Class discussion: What are other ways that this bias in facial recognition technology could be harmful?
Possible resonses:
* Use by police-- could lead to the wrong person being convicted of a crime
* etc.

8. Class discussion: What are ways that facial recognition technology could be helpful?
* Tagging images on social media
* Could be used to replace normal lock and keys
* etc.

10. Pair share: One proposal has been to train the AI on a less biased sample by using pictures from the DMV rather than images submitted voluntarily. Do you think that facial recognition AI should be created this way? Why/why not?

9. Written response: Students respond to the same prompt in a paragraph response

### Acknowledgement
This is a lesson that I originally learned about from Marisa Schuman.

## How Lesson Relates to Standard 9-12.IC.1
9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

This lesson is focused on facial recognition AI and its impact on society. Students will discuss how this technology can perpetuate and exacerbate inequality by replicating any biases in its training data. In particular, facial recognition AI disproportionately misgenders black women due to a much smaller sample size of images in the training data, leading to inequities in who is represented in the software. Students discuss the lack of access for black women to use this technology as opposed to others and how this is harmful. Students discuss how this technology can lend influence to certain groups, like the police when testifying to a jury. Students discuss both the harms that stem from biased facial recognition AI as well as the potential benefits from the technology.
