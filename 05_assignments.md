# Assignments
I wrote two assignments for the Arduino Motors unit that I am developing. Both assignments are uploaded into the repo with a name that starts with "05_assignments" so please check them out!

## Assignment 1: Arduino Stepper Motor
This assignment is a classwork assignment that can be used as a formative assessment. Students will work on this assignment in class with their partner over 2-3 days.
The assignment provides some brief background information on stepper motors, then instructions for hooking up the hardware, starter code and instructions for software, some basic questions, and a series of challenges at the end. Please see the assignment file for student-facing instructions.

## Assignment 2: Windmill Assessment
This assignment is the summative assessment for the unit and counts as a project grade in the assessment grading category. Students in my class will be paired with students in Mr. Wala's freshmen engineering class. The freshmen students will design and construct model windmills, and my students will connect the windmills to motors and program the Arduino to animate them. In addition, they will need to incorporate user input (such as through a button) such that the user can turn the windmill on/off and control its speed.

Please open the assignments to see the student-facing instructions! They are too long to completely copy here.
